Render one report using the quarto R package:

```{r}
library(quarto)
quarto_render(
  input = "example-3.qmd",
  execute_params = list(
    continent = "Europe"
  )
)
```

Use the purrr package to create multiple reports at the same time:

```{r}
library(purrr)
walk(
  .x = unique(gapminder$continent),
  .f = ~quarto_render(
    input = "example-3.qmd",
    execute_params = list(
      choose_continent = .x
    )
  )
)
```
Why is there only one report? We need to give each report a different name, to stop it being overwritten. Let’s use glue() again, this time for the file names.

```{r}
walk(
  .x = unique(gapminder$continent),
  .f = ~quarto_render(
    input = "example-3.qmd",
    output_file = glue("report_{.x}.html"),
    execute_params = list(
      choose_continent = .x
    )
  )
)
```
To ensure the images aren’t overwritten as well, you may need to add embed-resources: true to your Quarto document YAML:
